Network Design and Emulation for a PCI-DSS Compliant Hadoop Cluster Infrastructure


Network Design and Emulation for a PCI-DSS Compliant Hadoop Cluster Infrastructure

Overview

This repository documents the final-year capstone project of Daniel Obi-Nwosu, completed as part of the Computer Networking Technology Program at Holland College. The project, entitled "Network Design and Emulation for a PCI-DSS Compliant Hadoop Cluster Infrastructure," presents a practical synthesis of regulatory compliance, cloud and on-premise networking, and enterprise-level security engineering.

Purpose and Scope

The project was developed to address the architectural and compliance challenges faced by organisations processing sensitive cardholder dataâ€”particularly in the fintech sector. With PCI DSS v4.0.1 as the guiding standard, the report outlines the design and simulation of a scalable, segmented, and secure hybrid infrastructure supporting Hadoop-based analytics.

Danielâ€™s design spans from physical topologyâ€”featuring spine-leaf fabricâ€”to routing strategies that include VRF, OSPF, BGP EVPN, and VXLAN overlays. Cloud integration with Azure was emulated through secure IPSec tunnels, and access controls were meticulously defined via ACLs, AAA systems, and role-based access within Microsoft Active Directory.

Simulation Environment

Cisco Modeling Labs (CML) served as the emulation environment for this project. Despite limitations in virtual machine count, Daniel successfully validated critical security mechanisms, routing behaviour, and segmentation policies, with a focus on protecting the Cardholder Data Environment (CDE).
